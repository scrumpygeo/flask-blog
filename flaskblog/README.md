# Flask Blog App

App from an excellent and in depth Flask development course by Corey Schafer

Development followed these stages:

1. Start off writing basic app as a module.

   - develop templates for posts and user input
   - start with SQLite using Flasl-SQLAlchemy -> lets us easily change to PostgreSQL or other DB later

2. As app grows refactor into package structure

3. Add user authentication via tokens and allow import of avatars or user images associated with account

4. Implement posts as CRUD

5. Implement pagination and password reset via email

6. Refactor to Blueprints structure to allow better scaling of app.

7. Add custom error pages
